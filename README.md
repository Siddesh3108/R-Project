# Cyber Attack Data Analysis in R

This repository contains an R script for analyzing a dataset related to cyber attacks. The dataset, `Cyber_Attack.csv`, includes various features such as the number of cyber attacks and the probability of safety measures.

The R script performs the following operations:

1. **Data Loading**: The CSV file is read into a dataframe using R's built-in `read.csv` function.
2. **Data Overview**: The structure and summary of the dataframe are printed using R's `str` and `summary` functions to provide a quick overview of the data.
3. **Data Visualization**: A scatter plot and a boxplot are created using R's `plot` and `boxplot` functions to visualize the relationship between the number of cyber attacks and the probability of safety measures.
4. **Data Exploration**: The number of rows and columns in the dataframe are printed using R's `nrow` and `ncol` functions. Additionally, the second row and the first few rows of the dataframe are printed using R's indexing and `head` functions for a more detailed view of the data.

This script provides a starting point for further analysis and can be expanded to include more complex data processing and visualization techniques in R.
